# Airbnb data analysis

I would like to propose an exercise of information analysis and modeling from beginning to end, highlighting what in my opinion are the best practices.

First of all, we must understand the business and its needs.

Today AirBNB has become the largest digital platform to offer and search for accommodation in the world. Airbnb currently has an offering of about 2,000,000 properties in 192 countries and 33,000 cities.

So we would like to ask some relevant questions for the business in this particular case.

What are the main factors that determine the price of accommodation?
As in traditional hotels, does offering amenities impact the final price?
Which Seattle neighborhood is the most expensive and cheapest to rent?

# Results

This analysis shows the importance of the entire process and the CRISP-DP methodology, it also denotes the relevant factors when it comes to creating a business case. Additionally, it allows determining the relevant factors that determine the price of the accommodations posted on Airbnb, drawing up a preventive model on this.
